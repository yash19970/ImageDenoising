# ImageDenoising
This project aims on detecting different types of noise in images and then applying different methods for removing the noise(s).
This is a course project in Digital Image Processing, we are trying to identify the type of noise(s) present in the image.
If there are more than one type of noise, then detect them and develop the algorithm to make the image as noise-free as possible.
  1. Filters are used for different types of Images.
  2. Histograms are plotted for clear view of pixel distribution.
