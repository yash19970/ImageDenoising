# Image Denoiser.

### Instructions:
1. Open the Folder containing the Matlab code.<br />
2. Main code is in:  Denoise.m<br />
3. Run the matlab code in Matlab 11, by adding a path to it.<br />
4. The input image is in the same folder (name: 'sp.jpg') you can change the input file.<br /> 
 4.1. If the input is normal camera image, then you need to convert it to grayscale,the function is being used which has been commented,you need to uncomment it,<br />
	4.2. else the code is ready for use.<br />
	4.3 We have tested the code for Image sizes 512X512,taken from standard image datasets.<br />
5. All the Hardware/ Software requirements are included in report.<br />	
6. Research Papers:<br />
	6.1. A Survey Paper on Various Median Filtering Techniques for Noise Removal from Digital Image.
